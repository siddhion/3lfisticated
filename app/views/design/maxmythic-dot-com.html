  <p>
  I realized eventually I'd need a site to build my cred and be seen as legit so I started sketching concept sketches for a responsive, mobile first site that would showcase my design and illustration work effectively. I flirted with a few different user interface (UI) styles. Ultimately I settled on a bottom pinned navigation bar after reading Luke Wroblewski's article <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1649">Responsive Navigation: Optimizing for Touch Across Devices</a>. Luke's article brought up a big tablet and smart phone user experience (UX) issue that I could not live with on my site. While it was awkward to place the navigation bar at the bottom, I knew mobile users would appreciate it. For those using a desktop browser to view the site, they would see a left side bar navigation which give a lot of vertical space for my images to fill up.
  </p>
  <h3>The Next Version</h3>
  <p>
  I plan on enhancing my site in a number of ways. One is to incorporate touch events into my UI structure so people on mobile devices can flick through my projects as if they were looking through a photo album on their device. 
  </p>
  <p>I also want to make it quick and easy for users to have access to all my project thumbnails. For this I will employ Jason Weaver's <a target="_blank" href="http://jasonweaver.name/lab/offcanvas/">Off Canvas</a> design pattern. It will allow users to touch, or click, a gallery button that will slide in my project thumbnail gallery from the left hand side. Additionally I will have a menu button that a user can click that will slide in my main site navigation UI from the right hand side.  
  </p>
  <p>
  Another change I would like to code in is some animations to make page transitions easier on the eye. For example, when a user clicks a project thumbnail, I want the thumbnail gallery to slide off screen to the left and the project page to slide in from the right. It will be slightly tricky to implement but it has to be done to improve the overall UX.
  </p>
  <p>
  Lastly I would like to incorporate a pricing app into the site so potential clients can click the services they'd like me to render. Next to each service will be a price and a real time project total will be displayed at the bottom of the page. For example, a client wants an illustration with 3 different types of font. They have a title that uses 15 letters. They want that title to be made with a custom, 3d font. So they will select</p> 
  <ul>
    <li>font : custom</li>
    <li>letters : 15</li>
    <li>style : 3D</li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  <p>They also want 3 paragraphs of text that does not have to be written in a custom font. Lastly, they want a quote created in a realistic hand written style. Each one of those has a price attached to it. With this pricing app I will accurately be able to charge them. I hope that will make pricing easy to understand and simple.
