  <h3 class="image-group-title">My Original 2009 Dam-Funk Fan Logo</h3>

  <h2 class="design-title">Dam-Funk Logo</h2>

  <h2 class="year">2012</h2>

  <p>
  I first heard Dam-Funk's music on Myspace in early 2009 and immediately fell in love with it. It brought back memories of my childhood instantly. I did a logo for him out of my appreciation and he liked it. Later that year in the summer, he approached me to do a redesign of the logo for his upcoming debut LP release on Stones Throw called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stonesthrow.com/store/album/damfunk/toeachizown">Toeachizown</a>. The final logo was taken and used on the album which was first released as a 5 LP boxed vinyl set, then on each of the 5 individual vinyl volumes sold separately and lastly on the full-length CD.  
  </p>
  <p>
  Later in 2012 I slightly redesigned Dam-Funk's Toeachizown logo to color and texture match the first 2009 fan logo I did for him. Stones Throw took my new redesign and gave it to Stussy Japan to make into a t-shirt and flier to promote Dam-Funk's 2012 Japan tour => <a target="_blank" href="http://stussy.jp/blog/2012/10/20/stones-throw-stussy-present-dam-funk-japan-tour-2012/">STUSSY Ã— STONES THROW : DAM-FUNK JAPAN TOUR TEE</a>. 
  </p>

  Additionally Damon asked if I still had one of the concept designs I made for his 2009 logo. It was a simple D and F side by side. He wanted to use it as a t-shirt design which is now available in his <a target="_blank" href="http://damfunk.bigcartel.com/">online store</a>.
