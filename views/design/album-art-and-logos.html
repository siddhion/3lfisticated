  I first heard <a href="http://stonesthrow.com/damfunk" target="_blank">Dam-Funk</a>'s music on Myspace in early 2009 and immediately fell in love with it so I did a logo for him out of my appreciation. He liked it and later that year in the summer, he approached me to do a redesign of the logo for his upcoming debut LP release on Stones Throw called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stonesthrow.com/store/album/damfunk/toeachizown">Toeachizown</a>. The final logo was taken and used on the album cover which was first released as a 5 LP boxed vinyl set, then on each of the 5 individual vinyl volumes sold separately and lastly on the full-length CD.  
  </p>
  <p>
  Later in 2012 I reconnected with Dam-Funk and slightly redesigned Dam-Funk's Toeachizown logo to color and texture match the first 2009 fan logo I did for him. That original logo had an L.A. sunset image background. Stones Throw took my new redesign and gave it to Stussy Japan to make into a t-shirt and flier to promote Dam-Funk's 2012 Japan tour => <a target="_blank" href="http://stussy.jp/blog/2012/10/20/stones-throw-stussy-present-dam-funk-japan-tour-2012/">STUSSY Ã— STONES THROW : DAM-FUNK JAPAN TOUR TEE</a>. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Additionally Dam-Funk asked if I still had one of the concept designs I made for his 2009 logo. It was a simple D and F side by side. He wanted to use it as a t-shirt design which is now available in his <a target="_blank" href="http://damfunk.bigcartel.com/">online store</a>.

  I am an avid listener to <b>The Best Show on WFMU</b> in podcast form and one of my favorite parts of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.friendsoftom.com/">The Best Show</a> is when <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/GaryThaSquirrel">Gary the Squirrel</a> makes an appearance. I laugh my ass off often and when <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/APMike">AP Mike</a> (The Best Show's assistant producer/call screener/CD burner) got <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2mziknRHHI">song attacked</a> by Gary and his band, The Heart Throbs, he made his own <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r2-fTk3PNs">answer, retaliation song</a> which Gary then remade into his own <a target="_blank" href="http://wfmu.org/flashplayer.php?version=2&show=45423&archive=78633">revenge song which can be heard at the 2:30:28 mark on the 499th episode</a> of The Best Show. This revenge song featured Gary rapping and at that point I had no choice but to get involved. You see, I also produce music (sometimes hip hop beats) so I made <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/maxmythic/garys-revenge-on-ap-mike">a remix</a> of Gary's remix of AP Mike's revenge song, Gary, which Tom Scharpling amazingly played on <a target="_blank" href="http://wfmu.org/flashplayer.php?version=2&show=45775&archive=79081">500th episode of The Best Show at the 1:02:45 mark</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  So after a year or so, a friend of mine, Adam, told me that <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/scharpling">Tom Scharpling</a>, puppet master of Gary the Squirrel and host of The Best Show, was looking for the producer of the remix of Gary's rapping remix, which was me. So I got in touch with Tom, told him it was I and found out he wanted to include it as one track on the 2012 Best Show DJ premium downloadable CD that would be awarded to those who pledged a certain amount of money for the 2012 <a target="_blank" href="http://wfmu.org/">WFMU</a> Marathon. He also wanted to include <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/maxmythic/come-on-yall-itz-time-to-have-fun">my remix</a> of his acapella song <b>Come On Y'All It's Time To Have Fun</b>. I was very happy that my two tracks were going to be included on his downloadable CD 2012 DJ premium. Since I am an artist I was curious to see who was going to design the cover art and he said nobody was assigned to it yet. I offered my services and he agreed! Thanks Tom :)
  </p>
  <p>
    I decided to incorporate some, obvious and not so obvious, Best Show inside jokes into the cover. Gary is known to have major beef with AP Mike so I had to embroider "A.P. Mike" on his left boxing glove. Gary is also known to like nuts so an acorn was put on his right one. Also Gary often threatens Mike that he will "bop" him on the nose so I wrote "BOP" on the glove's wrist band. Vance loves prog-rock so I had him with a record that has PROG written on it. It can also be interpreted as RPGO, or Role Playing Game Organism, since he looks very alien. I incorporated an unwrapped PayDay bar because, Gary loves nuts and candy. Flying records for Vance, acorns for Gary and Mike's finger opening a Coors Tall Boy "Chi-Kuu" style, which he is known to do at least two times each show.
