  <p>
  TROONz is the name of a cartoon based side project of mine which also became my <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/troonz">dance music moniker</a>. The TROONz music sounds ike hip-hop sensibilities meets modern electro house. I used to be really into electronic music culture like 15 years ago but lost interest in it as my life focus turned more spiritual based. When I randomly saw a Youtube LIVE feed of the 2012 Tomorrowland festival I started researching what was now called EDM. I was partially seduced by the producer DJ life style and curious about how people were producing these songs. I really saturated myself in that culture from mid 2012 to mid 2013. It was very plastic and superficial. The new rave scene was nothing like it used to be. It was now pop. No longer the underground. I felt it was missing originality. So TROONz was my attempt at injecting a psychedlic essense into that culture. Now I don't really care about the pop element. The seduction of being an internationally famous DJ/producer has worn off it seems.
