  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/LemyLeopard">Lemy Leopard</a> told me about his collaboration with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.laetitia-dana.com/">Laëtitia Dana</a> named <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/lounge-coffee">Lounge Coffee</a> in late 2012. Set to be a self titled EP, Lounge Coffee would be a deep vocal house record. Since it was a digital release only, just the front cover art needed to be designed and I got on it right away.

  <p>
  Lemy and Laëtitia wanted the cover art to be of a loungy vibe with earthy, coffee tones but it also had to reflect the nature of dance and house music. The background characters dancing were drawing in a brush that looked like a stylized coffee stain. Each character is sending energy to each other, connecting each other to make one circuit.
