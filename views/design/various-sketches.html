  <b>Architech</b> was a dual sketch image that represented my kind of entry into programming. The top sketch is a picture of someone, me I guess, burning the midnight oil in a frenetic programming session. The bottom image is of a silly interpretation of future in-brain computing technology in which our brains are interfaced with an ultra-fast, nanoscale computer. Silly because I seriously doubt we will have or need a HUD for interfacing with in-brain computers. Rather, we will use <a target="_blank" href="http://maxmythic.blogspot.com/2012/01/death-of-gui.html">pure thought to interface with computers</a>. The only graphic elements we will see is video and images.

  <b>Marc Maron the Cat Wrangler</b> was a quick sketch I made after reading Marc's Twitter bio which states he's a 'feral cat wrangler'. While I am not a feral cat wrangler, I do have two felines and relate to Marc's experience living with and interacting with cats. I also often listen to his pod cast, WTF. I uploaded the pic to Twitter and <a href="https://twitter.com/MaxMythic/status/232183819896246273" target="_blank">he retweeted it</a> which was cool.    
  </p>

  <b>Fishy Touch</b> is an image I drew back in 2010 which was my representation of <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/pixelord">Pixelord's</a> track <a href="https://soundcloud.com/error-broadcast/pixelord-fish-touch">Fishy Touch</a>. 
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Chaos Conspiracies</b> was drawn at a time when I was listening to a lot of alternative news sources which were discussing conspiracy theories or as they would call them, conspiracy facts. If you look around this mural you can see some references so some issues that were happening at the time in the US and even internationally.

  <b>Squirrel Sew</b> is a cryptic drawing. The squirrel is sewing its own leg out of a loop string. Its hood has a 1 & 0 in an infinity sign. 1s and 0s are what programs are made of. Similar to the on and off nature of reality.  Nature and technology merging. Or maybe nature is a form of technology for souls to inhabit. Why is it measuring the distance between its chin to its shoulder? Is it even doing that? And look its eye is a pin hole. Its holding a needle. Did he stab itself a pupil? Or did the needle come from its pupil eye hole? Look at the location of the needle. Is the needle it's penis? Eye sex? I'll stop now.
