Hello my name is Adam and my designer name is 3lfist. While I used to primarily focus on graphic design and illustration, my main focuses now are UX design and web development. I am currently designing and developing my own gamified photo sharing app using web technologies like AngularJS, Firebase, Git, Foundation 5, CSS3, HTML5 and SASS. My design process starts out with me hand drawing mockups of the app. This includes user interactions, page flow and many notes on the behaviour of the app.

<p class="about-info">My approach to UX is holistic. I take into consideration almost every aspect of the product :</p> 
<ul>
  <li>
