<p class="about-info">I’m a designer, art director and web developer that likes to work on interesting projects with interesting people. Usually that involves people in the music and entertainment industries but not always. Often I’ll change up my style to keep things fresh, novel and interesting for the client and myself.</p> 

<p class="about-info">Each new project presents a new set of design and artistic challenges that I face with an open mind. Many idea comes to mind but through much thought and discernment, I will filter them down to the most powerful ones.</p> 
<p class="about-info">Each design and/or illustration I create must be:</p>
<ul class="pretty">
  <li class="about-list">
    able to effectively communicate the essence of the music or entertainment it represents
  </li>
  <li class="about-list">
    compositionally balanced</li>
  <li class="about-list">
    seductive & mesmerising
  </li> 
</ul>
<p class="about-info">On the side I like to produce music also of varying styles under the <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/maxmythic">Max Mythic</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/troonz">TROONz</a> monikers.
