  I am an avid listener to The Best Show in podcast form and one of my favorite parts of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.friendsoftom.com/">The Best Show</a> is when <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/GaryThaSquirrel">Gary the Squirrel</a> makes an appearance. I laugh my arse off every time and when <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/APMike">AP Mike</a> (The Best Show's assistant producer/call screener) got <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2mziknRHHI">song attacked</a> by Gary and his band, The Heart Throbs, he made his own <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r2-fTk3PNs">answer, retaliation song</a> which Gary remade into his own <a target="_blank" href="http://wfmu.org/flashplayer.php?version=2&show=45423&archive=78633">revenge song which can be heard at the 2:30:28 mark on the 499th episode</a> of The Best Show on WFMU. This revenge song featured Gary rapping and at that point I had no choice but to get involved. You see, I also produce music so I made <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/maxmythic/garys-revenge-on-ap-mike">a remix</a> of Gary's remix of AP Mike's revenge song, Gary, which was amazingly played on <a target="_blank" href="http://wfmu.org/flashplayer.php?version=2&show=45775&archive=79081">500th episode of The Best Show at the 1:02:45 mark</a>.

  So after a year or so, a friend of mine told me that <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/scharpling">Tom Scharpling</a>, puppet master of Gary the Squirrel and host of The Best Show, was looking for the producer of the remix of Gary's rapping remix. I got in touch with Tom, told him it was I and found out he wanted to include it as one track on the 2012 Best Show DJ premium downloadable CD that would be awarded to those who pledged a certain amount of money for the 2012 <a target="_blank" href="http://wfmu.org/">WFMU</a> Marathon. He also wanted to include <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/maxmythic/come-on-yall-itz-time-to-have-fun">my remix</a> of his acapella song <b>Come On Y'All It's Time To Have Fun</b>. I was very happy that my two tracks were going to be included on his downloadable CD 2012 DJ premium. Since I am an artist I was curious to see who was going to design the cover art and he said nobody was assigned to it yet. I offered my services and he agreed! Thanks Tom!

    I decided to incorporate some, obvious and not so obvious, Best Show inside jokes into the cover. Gary is known to have major beef with AP Mike so I had to embroider "A.P. Mike" on his left boxing glove. Gary is also known to like nuts so an acorn was put on his right one. Also Gary often threatens Mike that he will "bop" him on the nose so I wrote "BOP" on the glove's wrist band. Vance loves prog-rock so I had him with a record that has PROG written on it. It can also be interpreted as RPGO, or Role Playing Game Organism, since he looks very alien. I incorporated an unwrapped PayDay bar because, Gary loves his nuts and candy. Flying records for Vance, acorns for Gary and Mike's finger opening a Coors Tall Boy "Chi-Kuu" style, which he is known to do at least two times each show.
