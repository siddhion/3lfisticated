  One morning in 2012 I woke up and drew this cartoon strip. Some might consider this to be a cynical view on relationships but I do not. Human relationships tend to involve pleasure and pain. I show this duality with each partner ripping the others heart out and eating all the while with a smile plastered upon their face. We are destroying each other and we get pleasure out of it. Wait, now I am talking about psychic vampirism and psychopathy. Or maybe it just combines the joy both partners have by being in each others' company with the terror they inflict on each other. So the strip is superimposing multiple good and evil time fragments of their relationship onto one moment. It's a paradox and to the untrained eye, it's nonsensical. Hopefully I shed some sense on it, or you only in the case that you were an untrained eye. For those in the know, well, glad you could join me for this viewing moment.
